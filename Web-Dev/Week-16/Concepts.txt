HTTP & Websockets uses -> TCP
WebRTC can use -> TCP or UDP

1-Simplex Channel: send the signals only in one direction.
Eg: Radio-station
2-Half-Duplex Channel: send signals in both directions but in only one direction at a time.
Eg: Walkie-Talkie
3-Full-Duplex Channel: send signals in both the directions at the same time.
Eg: Telephone

Bandwidth is like a road for data. It tells us how much data can travel through a 
connection in a certain amount of time.

Example: Imagine a water pipe. A bigger pipe (more bandwidth) can carry more water (data) 
at once, while a smaller pipe (less bandwidth) can carry less water.

In tech terms: Bandwidth is measured in bits per second (like Mbps or Gbps). 
If your internet has higher bandwidth, you can download or stream things faster because 
more data can move at the same time.

So, bandwidth is just the capacity of the connection to move data efficiently!
